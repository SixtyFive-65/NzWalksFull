### API talks to the domain models but its good practice to use DTOs to send data back to the client( don't sent back the domain model). ###

*DTO -> Data Transfer Object
 -Transfer data between different layers
 -contains subset of properties in the domain model

*Client -> DTO -> API -> DomainModel -> Database
	

Advantages of DTO 
   -Separation of concerns
   -Perfomance
   -Security
   -Versioning (change domain model without affecting request model)
